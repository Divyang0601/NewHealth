            Based on your info you may be suffering from Breast cancer

            <p>Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch
                of skin.
                <br></p>

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>
                <li>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast
                </li>
                <li>
                    Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling
                </li>
                <li>
                    A newly inverted nipple
                </li>
                <li>Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin</li>
                <li>Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast
                to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.<br> Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular
                carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.
                <br> Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors
                never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.</p>
